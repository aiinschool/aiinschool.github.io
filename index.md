# Creating Your Own AI

We'll be using Deep Learning, convolution

* What's it being used for?
* What is it?
  * Subcategory of machine learning, namely neural networks
  * About Neural networks
  * About Deep Learning, why deep?
    * Hierachy of data
    * Before - manual features
    * Now - full pipeline
* Why is it possible now?
  * Data - big data
  * Computational power - Gpus
  * Algorithms - Convolution

## Nvidia DIGITS

* About DIGITS
* Connecting to DIGITS

## Let's make a network

* The task: Image classification
* The process of training a (deep) neural network
* The dataset
  * The provided dataset
* Architecture (Segway to Caffe model)
  * fully connected
  * convolution
  * pooling
  * non-linearity
  * Let's train the first model
* Improving accuracy
  * increasing layers
* Reduce overfitting
  * dropout
